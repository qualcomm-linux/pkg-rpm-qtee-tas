# pkg-rpm-qtee-tas

This RPM packages [`qualcomm/qtee-tas`](https://github.com/qualcomm/qtee-tas) 
—  This package installs proprietary Qualcomm Trusted Application (TA) binary
blobs required by the QTEE (Qualcomm Trusted Execution Environment) firmware
stack.

This repo builds and publishes the `qtee-tas` RPM via the shared
[`qualcomm-linux/qcom-rpm-utils`](https://github.com/qualcomm-linux/qcom-rpm-utils)
reusable workflows — it follows the same one-package-per-repo template used
across `qualcomm-linux/pkg-rpm-*`.

## Branches

Following the Fedora/CentOS **dist-git** convention, each distro stream gets its
own branch, and the packaging files live at the branch root:

| Branch | Stream | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | — | Template docs, onboarding guide, community files. Nothing is built here. |
| **`c10s`** | CentOS 10 Stream | **This branch.** `qtee-tas.spec` + `sources` + workflows. |

Full onboarding guide, configuration reference, and troubleshooting live on
[`main`](../../tree/main) — see its `README.md` and `docs/workflows.md`.

## Installation Instructions

```
sudo rpm -i qtee-tas-x.aarch64.rpm
```

## CI: build on PR, release on demand

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| [`build-on-pr.yml`](.github/workflows/build-on-pr.yml) | Pull request | Build the RPM so reviewers confirm the package still builds. Read-only — never publishes. |
| [`pkg-release.yml`](.github/workflows/pkg-release.yml) | Manual (`workflow_dispatch`) | Build **and** publish the RPM to Artifactory, behind an approval gate. |

Both delegate to reusable workflows in `qcom-rpm-utils`, which run `rpmbuild`
inside the prebuilt `rpm-builder` container image. Required repo configuration
(`CACHE_BASE_URL` variable, `ARTIFACTORY_ACCESS_TOKEN` secret,
`pkg-release-approval` environment, runner pool access) is documented in full
in [`docs/workflows.md`](docs/workflows.md), along with the dist-git
sources/lookaside-cache model and a troubleshooting table.

This repo was created from [`qualcomm-linux/pkg-rpm-template`](https://github.com/qualcomm-linux/pkg-rpm-template);
see that template's README if you're onboarding a *different* package and
want the generic step-by-step instructions.
